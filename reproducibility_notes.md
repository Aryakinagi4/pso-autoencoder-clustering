# Reproducibility Notes

## Environment

- Python-based implementation
- Neural network framework for Autoencoder
- PSO implementation for centroid optimization

---

## Hyperparameters (From Research)

Autoencoder:
- Input dimension: 13,561
- Latent dimension: Reduced space
- Activation: ReLU / Sigmoid
- Loss: MSE

PSO:
- Inertia weight (w)
- Cognitive coefficient (c1)
- Social coefficient (c2)
- Number of particles
- Maximum iterations

---

## Notes

Exact numerical outputs may vary due to:

- Random initialization
- Hardware differences
- Dataset versioning

The methodology remains consistent with the published research.
